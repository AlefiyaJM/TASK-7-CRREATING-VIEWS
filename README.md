**Name:** Alefiya Joharbhai Managori  
**Subject:** Database Management System  
**Topic:** Use of SQL Views â€“ Complex SELECT, Abstraction, and Security

## ðŸ“Œ Objective

This task demonstrates the creation and application of **SQL views** using:
1. Complex `SELECT` statements involving joins and aggregations.
2. Views for abstraction and security to restrict or simplify data access.

---

## ðŸ”§ Part 1: CREATE VIEW with Complex SELECT

In this part, SQL views were created using complex queries that involved:

- Joins between multiple tables (e.g., `Orders`, `User`, `Product`)
- Grouping and aggregating data (e.g., total spending by users)
- Use of aliases and column formatting
- Displaying comprehensive information such as full order details and product categories

âœ… **Total Views Created:** 3  
âœ… **Purpose:** To simplify complex queries and encapsulate business logic

---

## ðŸ”’ Part 2: Views for Abstraction and Security

This part focused on creating views that:

- Hide sensitive fields (e.g., email, payment methods)
- Provide limited access for specific roles (e.g., support staff, public users)
- Help maintain data privacy and abstraction

âœ… **Total Views Created:** 3  
âœ… **Purpose:** To ensure secure and role-based access to underlying data

---

## ðŸ§ª Output

All views were successfully created and tested in MySQL.  
Each view returns the expected results and is optimized for specific use cases such as reporting, security, and modularity.
